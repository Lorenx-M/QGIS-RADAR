# QGIS-RADAR

This plugin can be used to create activity maps of rockfall release points within unstable slope sectors, with respect to specific elements at risk. 

The RADAR analysis is focused on the finalpoints vector file produced by QPROTO, another QGIS plugin for preliminary rockfall runout susceptibility analyses
based on a visibility analysis and the cone method. RADAR is therefore designed to be used sequentially with QPROTO. On the basis of the results of a QPROTO
runout susceptibility analysis, specific elements at risk can be highlighted such as structures, infrastructures, residential areas, touristic areas, existing 
protective measures, etc. On the other hand, each of these elements at risk is af-fected by the different points of the source area with a different frequency, 
i.e. there are sectors of the source area which most affect the element at risk.
